NextBox from any remote location as long as you have an internet connection

.. hint:: Even though the *Backwards Proxy* remote access method is a quick
   way to realize remote access, we **strongly recommend** to use a 
   :doc:`dynamic DNS setup<dynamic-dns>` or :doc:`static DNS setup<static>` 
   to maintain the best security level for your NextBox. *In most usage
   scenarios the latter will also provide a better data bandwidth and user 
   experience*
   
Before you set up a remote access method you might want to read the 
:doc:`comparison<method-comparison>` in order to understand
the trade-offs and capabilities of the different approaches:
