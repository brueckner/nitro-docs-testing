Factory Reset
=======================


.. Warning::

   Factory Resetting your NextBox will inevitably **delete all your files** on
   the NextBox and any configuration settings.

**To factory reset your NextBox simply press the hardware button for 5 seconds.**

The NextBox LED will change to *blue* once you press the button, after the 5
seconds have passed the color will change to blinking red (see :doc:`LED documentation <led-colors>`).
Once the LED has finally reached *green* again your NextBox is ready for the initial setup as 
described in :doc:`Getting Started <../gettingstarted>`

.. hint::
   The hardware button is a pinhole-style button similar to other embedded
   devices. In order to press it, it is recommended to use a thin (~1mm)
   needle-like pin. E.g., the pin to remove a sim-card from a smartphone is
   working great. **Further take care to not press the button too hard, 
   be careful, there should be a recognizable haptic feedback (button click) 
   with minimal applied force.**
