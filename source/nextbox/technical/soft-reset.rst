Soft Reset
=======================

**If ever your NextBox doesn't start or behaves strangely the soft reset might fix your problems**
The soft reset functionality tries to fix some common failures on your NextBox.
So whenever something is wrong, e.g. the NextBox doesn't start, the first thing you could try is
a soft reset.

**To start the soft reset on your NextBox simply press the hardware button 2 times within 2 seconds.**

The NextBox LED will change to *blue* on every press, after the second press
it will change to blinking blue (see :doc:`LED documentation <led-colors>`).
Once the LED has finally reached *green* again for at least 20 seconds your NextBox is ready for use again.
Please do not unplug your NextBox during this process as that might break something.

.. hint::
   The hardware button is a pinhole-style button similar to other embedded
   devices. In order to press it, it is recommended to use a thin (~1mm)
   needle-like pin. E.g., the pin to remove a sim-card from a smartphone is
   working great. **Further take care to not press the button too hard,
   be careful, there should be a recognizable haptic feedback (button click)
   with minimal applied force.**
