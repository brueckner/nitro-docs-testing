System update
=============

.. contents:: :local:

The NitroPad watches for changes to important system files to detect third-party tampering. This means that special steps are sometimes necessary when updating the system. This can often be recognized by the fact that the system prompts you to reboot.

Procedure After a System Update
###############################

Boot Hash Mismatch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you restart the NitroPad after an update, the startup screen
   should initially appear as usual without an error message.

2. If you press Enter afterwards, you will get an error message that
   looks like this or similar:

.. figure:: /nitropad/images/system-update/2.jpeg
   :alt: img2



3. Confirm the message with Enter to have the files changed by the
   system update verified. Afterwards you will be asked again for a
   confirmation.

4. Now insert the Nitrokey if this is not already the case and confirm
   with Enter. Then you must enter the User PIN of the Nitrokey
   (default: 123456). You will not see the characters you typed in on
   the screen.

   .. warning::
      Heads expects an English keyboard layout, on which e.g. “y” and “z” are swapped in comparison to the German keyboard layout. If you agree with the default selection (which is written in capital letter) you can also simply confirm by pressing Enter.

.. code-block:: bash

   Please confirm that your GPG card is inserted [Y/n]:
    
   Verifying presence of GPG card...
    
   XXXXXXX: XXXXXXXXXX
   Please unlock the card
    
   Number: XXXX XXXXXX
   Holder: 
   Counter: X
   PIN: 

Now the NitroPad marks the files changed by the update as verified.

Boot Entry Has Changed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5. Next, either another error message appears or the operating system
   starts. This depends on the system update. If the following error
   message appears, proceeds as described below:

6. First confirm the error message shown above. Then we see a list of
   all possible boat entries - choose the first one by simply pressing
   Enter.

7. To save this value as default, select the option “Make Ubuntu the
   default” for Ubuntu or “Make Qubes the default” for Qubes OS in the
   next window.

8. Now the Nitrokey has to be plugged in, if this is not yet the case.

|   Confirm the question "Do you wish to add a disk encryption to the TPM" with N.
|   Confirm the question "Please confirm that your GPG card is inserted" with Y.
|   Enter the User PIN of the Nitrokey whenever prompted (default: 123456).
