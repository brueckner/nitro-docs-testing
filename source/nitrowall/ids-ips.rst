How to set up IDS/IPS with Suricata
===================================

OPNSense uses Suricata to provide an IPS/IDS Service.
Suricata is already installed and running after initial configuration.

You find the administration, monitoring and logging settings via "Services -> Intrusion Detection".

More information on how to configure IDS/IPS are available on:
