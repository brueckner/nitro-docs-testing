From now on, when signing in you need an OTP additionally to your password. Get one by the Nitrokey App like before and insert it in when logging in.

Nextcloud provides you with backup codes, in case you lost your Nitrokey. It is recommended to print out these codes and store them somewhere save otherwise you might not be able to log in to your account anymore!
