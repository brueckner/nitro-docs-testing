6. Enter the user PIN which you defined previously in step 4. Wait a
   moment until a new keypair and certificate are generated. In case
   your Nitrokey is not detected you may want to execute “certutil
   -scinfo” for troubleshooting.

You may perform further configurations such as activate the force smart card policy or automatically lock the computer when removing the Nitrokey (by using EIDConfigurationWizardElevated.exe).

From now on, when logging on to your Windows computer you need to connect the Nitrokey and enter your PIN.
