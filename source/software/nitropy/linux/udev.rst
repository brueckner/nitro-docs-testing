Setting up The udev Rules
=========================

To be able to access your devices without root privileges, nitropy requires the
Nitrokey udev rules. If they are not shipped with your distribution, you can
install the rules manually::

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-udev-rules/main/41-nitrokey.rules
    sudo mv 41-nitrokey.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

The legacy rules are also shipped with `libnitrokey <https://github.com/Nitrokey/libnitrokey>`__.


You most likely want to change the owner and the permissions of this file::

    sudo chown root:root /etc/udev/rules.d/41-nitrokey.rules
    sudo chmod 644 /etc/udev/rules.d/41-nitrokey.rules

After installing the rules, you need to reload them::

    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger

If you still cannot access your device, try again after rebooting your system.
If you encouter issues, look at this `github comment <https://github.com/Nitrokey/pynitrokey/issues/167#issuecomment-1024921046>`__
for some debugging hints.
