Firmware Update
===============

.. contents:: :local:

.. warning::

   You should backup all data from the device before upgrading, as
   firmware upgrades may destroy all data on the device (especially
   coming from firmware version <0.45)!

.. important::
   Never disconnect the Nitrokey Start or abort the process while updating,
   this will likely render your device useless


1. Download the `Nitrokey App <https://www.nitrokey.com/download>`__ and the program “dfu-programmer” which should be available through your package-manager, e.g. ``apt-get update && apt-get install dfu-programmer`` on Debian-based systems.

2. Download the latest firmware ".hex" file from `here <https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-storage-firmware/releases/latest>`__ and store it as "firmware.hex" in your home folder. Older releases are `here <https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-storage-firmware/releases>`__.

3. Right click on the icon of the Nitrokey App and go to “Configure” -> “Enable Firmware Update”. The default firmware password is ‘12345678’.

   .. note::

      The Nitrokey Storage is not detected by Nitrokey App anymore once update mode got
      activated. You have to proceed with the instructions described below
      to make it work again.


4. Open a terminal and execute:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo dfu-programmer at32uc3a3256s erase
      sudo dfu-programmer at32uc3a3256s flash --suppress-bootloader-mem firmware.hex
      sudo dfu-programmer at32uc3a3256s launch
      # versions <0.7 of dfu-programmer use "start" instead of "launch"

   whereas “firmware.hex” needs to be the path and file name of the firmware which you downloaded in step 2.
