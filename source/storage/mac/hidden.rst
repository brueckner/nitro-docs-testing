Using hidden volumes
--------------------

1. Unlock the encrypted volume.

2. Select "unlock hidden volume" and enter any of the hidden volume's passwords.

3. If this is the first time you unlock the hidden volume, you may need to create a partition on the hidden volume. You will need to use `Disk Utility <https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/disk-utility/dskutl14027/mac>`__. Make sure to create the partitions on the device that appeared when unlocking the hidden volume.

4. Make sure to unmount/eject all partitions on the hidden volumes before locking or disconnecting the Nitrokey.
